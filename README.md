# Factcheck-GPT
Fact-Checking the Output of Generative Large Language Models in both Annotation and Evaluation.

### Try our dataset and the annotation tool, code for experiments will come soon.
### Try your methods on five subtasks
(1) identifying whether the sentence contains factual statement; 
(2) detecting the check-worthiness of a claim by categories of factual, opinion, not a claim and other;
(3) judging the stance of a given evidence against a claim, whether it supports, partially supports, refute or is irrelevant to the claim;
(4) determining whether a claim is factually true or false, give a claim without gold evidence, if false, revising it into a correct one;
(5) editing a list of originally-true or revised claims into a new response, given the original response, to correct the factual errors while preserving the linguistic features and style of the original.
